        "**2. Batch Size Impact**\n",
        "- Increasing batch size from 16 → 32 in YOLOv11s maintained similar mAP50 (0.375) and slightly reduced mAP50-95 (0.149), but drastically increased precision to 0.661.\n",
        "- However, recall slightly decreased, suggesting the model became more conservative (fewer false positives, more false negatives).\n",

        "- YOLOv11m (larger model) had only a marginal mAP50 gain (0.369) at the cost of much higher compute (67.7 GFLOPs).\n",

        "- It had the lowest recall (0.293) and relatively low precision.\n",
        "- ❌ Conclusion: AdamW was detrimental here, possibly due to improper LR scheduling or poor fit for this detection task.\n",

        " - mAP50 = 0.366, mAP50-95 = 0.146, precision and recall very comparable.\n",
        " - Slightly better tear-ripped and hole detection, based on breakdown.\n",
        "- ✅ Conclusion: Cosine works as well as default, with more stable learning rate decay, and can be safely used."
